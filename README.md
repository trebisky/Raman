Raman mineral spectrum software

The file raman.py is what you want here.

This is software, written in Python, to display and manipulate
Raman mineral spectrum data.

This is intended as a more portable alternative to CrystalSleuth.

It is a work in progress (but what isn't?).

Development is being done under linux.  To test on Windows, this
is what you do:

+ Click on the "Git bash" icon
+ cd Raman
+ git pull
+ python opener.py (or whatever)
